## GANdalf

GANdalf trains auto-encoding generative adversarial networks.

Autoencoding GANs are trained with two objectives:

* Generate realistic-looking fake examples based on an input vector of random noise from a low-dimensional "latent space".
* Compress real examples by encoding them into points in that latent space, then decoding them back to their original form

GANdalf adds a third objective:

* Given a point in the latent space, predict attributes about it with a classifier network

For any example, we can compute the gradient of a classifier's output with respect to the example's encoding in latent space.
By gradient descent, the example can be perturbed in such a way that it resembles the original example as much as possible, while being classified in a different desired way.
We term such a perturbed example a "counterfactual" example.

By choosing an appropriate classifier and target, counterfactual examples can be generated for a variety of useful tasks.

### Code Structure

Runs on Ubuntu, under Python 3.5. Requires CUDA and PyTorch 0.2 or higher. For other requirements, run `install_requirements.sh`.

#### Datasets

The input to each experiment is a `.dataset` file. These files can be generated by the scripts in `datasets/`.

#### Experiments

Each experiment is an executable Python script. Run `experiments/train_aac.py` to start training a manifold.

#### Counterfactuals

After a network has trained for at least one epoch, use it to generate counterfactuals with `experiments/generate_counterfactual.py`
